# Experimentory Rover


This starter code is for the Experimentory Summer Program's Theater and Electronics Cluster. Students are creating a line 
following robot to perform a theater scene that they will record and voice over.

Example of a line following robot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmdRzyuT-o

Students will be using a rover kit from Adafruit as their basis with a TB6612 dual h-bridge to run the motors.

Two photoresistors will track the robot's location compared to a line.
